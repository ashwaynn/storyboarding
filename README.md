# storyboarding
Automatic generation of movie storyboards from raw movie scripts using NLP techniques.

## Documentation
* [Preprocesing](preprocessing/README.md) (Extracts Actors, Groups, Props, Location and also suggests new props)

A storyboard is a graphic organizer in the form of illustrations or images displayed in sequence for the purpose of previsualizing a motion picture, animation, motion graphic or interactive media sequence. Storyboarding is one of the important tasks that needs to be done prior to movie shooting. Storyboarding helps to visualise the screenplay. This project aims to automate the process of creating storyboards and thus reducing the pre-shooting tasks.  
First phase of generating automated storyboards is to extract information such as Actors, Groups, Props, Location for each scene in the movie script. Refer [here](preprocessing/README.md) for more on preprocessing.
